Welcome to the gh-pages branch!

If this is your first time here, please refer to the repository's associated web page [here](https://joshholla.github.io/neuro_noodle/). (It contains my findings and presents my code)

I thought the best way to talk about and show my work would be through a webpage. This repository contains the HTML files for the [website](https://joshholla.github.io/neuro_noodle/).  
Feel free to browse through them!
